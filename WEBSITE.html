My mothers name is <i> <strong>ERNA M. JESALVA </strong>and My Father is <i> <strong>ROLANDO JOSE ABETO </strong> we live in <i><strong>Pacheco Compound Santan St. Fortune Marikina City</strong>.<br></sub>
<Sub>I was a student at <i><strong> Fortune Elementary School </strong>and <i><strong>High School </strong>at that time I always wanted to play video games at the Computer shop after school I also played a lot of games in the street
such as heaven and earth or langit lupa in Tagalog and basketball even now I still play basketball.</sup><br></sub>
<Sub>In my first day at school my mom brought me to school at the first day of first semester to make sure I got to school safely but when I stepped into the classroom I immediately cried 
out of fear pf our teacher, I wasn't scared of the way she looks but because of the wooden baton she was holding.<sup><br></p></sub>
